Agents monitoring the live tickets in the agent panel will notice the incoming tickets. Queue managers are responsible for assigning priority tickets to suitable agents and ensuring appropriate Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are applied. Agents, like Jane Doe, can engage with tickets by posting replies, detailing the steps taken to address the reported issue.

<p>
In this scenario, the ticket's priority is elevated to Emergency due to its critical nature to business operations. Adjustments to SLA plans and assignment to top-tier technicians are made accordingly. Jane Doe, the assigned agent, communicates her ongoing efforts along with the system administration team to resolve the issue.

Once the issues are successfully resolved, the agent can mark the ticket as closed. Closed tickets are then archived, segregated from active tickets. Details such as resolution date and the responsible agent are recorded for future reference.
